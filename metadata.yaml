description: "Lieut. Gullivar Jones: His Vacation is the last novel by Edwin Lester\
  \ Arnold, combining elements of both fantasy and science fiction, first published\
  \ in 1905. Its lukewarm reception led him to stop writing fiction. It has since\
  \ become his best known work, and is considered important in the development of\
  \ 20th century science fiction in that it is a precursor and likely inspiration\
  \ to Edgar Rice Burroughs's classic A Princess of Mars (1917), which spawned the\
  \ sword and planet genre. Ace Books reprinted Arnold's novel in paperback in 1964,\
  \ retitling it Gulliver  [sic] of Mars. A more recent Bison Books edition (2003)\
  \ was issued as Gullivar of Mars, adapting the Ace title to Arnold's spelling.\n\
